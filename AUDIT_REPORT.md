# Qiyal.ai Backend - Code Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-10-05

This report outlines the current state of the Qiyal.ai backend codebase, identifies architectural issues, and details gaps based on the comprehensive restoration and development specification.

---

## 1. File & Directory Structure Analysis

The backend follows a standard Node.js/Express project structure, located in the `backend/` directory. The source code is organized under `backend/src/` into the following modules:

-   `controllers/`: Handles incoming API requests and orchestrates responses.
-   `middleware/`: Contains middleware for authentication, validation, and error handling.
-   `migrations/`: Contains SQL files for database schema setup.
-   `models/`: Provides a data access layer for interacting with the database.
-   `routes/`: Defines the API endpoints.
-   `services/`: Encapsulates the core business logic.
-   `utils/`: Contains utility functions like database connection and logging.

A `server.js` file acts as the application's entry point.

## 2. Architectural State & Module Compatibility

### 2.1. Current State

-   **Module System:** The project is in a state of conflict. The `package.json` specifies `"type": "module"`, mandating ES Modules (ESM) syntax. However, key files, most notably the root `server.js`, are still using the outdated CommonJS (`require`/`module.exports`) syntax. This is a critical architectural flaw that prevents the application from running correctly.
-   **Dependencies:** The project utilizes appropriate libraries for its purpose, including `express`, `pg` (for PostgreSQL), `jsonwebtoken`, `bcryptjs`, and `joi`. All necessary dependencies appear to be installed.
-   **Configuration:** The application is configured via a `.env` file, which is a standard practice.

### 2.2. Identified Issues & Required Fixes

-   **[CRITICAL] ESM/CommonJS Conflict:** The entire application must be standardized to use ES Modules. This involves rewriting `server.js` and verifying that all files under `src/` use `import`/`export` syntax correctly.
-   **[CRITICAL] Missing `server.js` Implementation:** The main `server.js` file lacks the complete and correct setup for middleware (CORS, Helmet, logging), routing, and error handling as specified in the new requirements.
-   **[MAJOR] Incomplete Business Logic:** The services, while structurally present, are missing key business logic detailed in the new specification (e.g., social network features, real-time chat logic, advanced payment processing).
-   **[MINOR] Inconsistent Naming:** Some files use camelCase (e.g., `projectService.js`) while others use kebab-case or are just single words. A consistent naming convention should be enforced.

## 3. Feature & Module Gap Analysis

The current implementation provides a basic, non-functional skeleton for a freelance marketplace. The following key modules, as required by the new specification, are entirely **missing**:

-   **Social Network Module:**
    -   No database tables exist for `posts`, `comments`, `likes`, or `follows`.
    -   No models, services, controllers, or routes have been implemented for social features.
-   **Chat & Messaging Module:**
    -   No database tables exist for `conversations`, `messages`, or `participants`.
    -   The real-time `socket.io` logic is not integrated into the main application server.
-   **Advanced Payment System:**
    -   No database tables exist for `payments`, `transactions`, or `user_balances`.
    -   No services exist for integrating with payment gateways like Kaspi.
-   **Testing Suite:**
    -   The project has **zero** tests (unit, integration, or E2E). This is a critical gap for a production-ready application.
-   **AI Assistant Integration:**
    -   A placeholder `gemini.service.js` exists, but it contains no actual implementation for AI-powered features.

## 4. Conclusion & Path Forward

The backend is in a broken, non-runnable state due to fundamental architectural conflicts (ESM/CJS). The immediate priority is to fix the core architecture as detailed in **Phase 1** of the specification.

Once the application is stable, development must proceed to **Phase 2** to build out the missing social, chat, and payment modules from the ground up, following the detailed instructions provided. Finally, a comprehensive testing suite must be created to ensure code quality and reliability.
